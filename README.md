# AdventOfCode2020
Hsv.py Advent of Code 2020 Repository: Share code, tips, notes, and other useful info!

<h1>Hsv.py Advent of Code 2020!</h1>
This repository is meant for sharing code, tricks, tips, and anything that would be beneficial to others learning and improving their python skills. All ages and coding skill levels are invited to participate! Enjoy the challenge and remember to have fun!

<h3>How to contribute to this repo</h3>
Feel free to fork this repo and add your code to your fork. Please save any shared files with your name (or nickname--something that can be used to identify you through the meetup) and the challenge day number. If your code pertains to a specific part of the challenge (for example, the second star on day 3), please include the part in the filename. For example: <br>
guidoVanRossum_day03part2.py

<h3>How to get help</h3>
You can always e-mail us at Huntsville.py@gmail.com.

If you have trouble using the Git repository or need Git help, message Ashley directly on Meetup. She likes to brag about her Git abilities and enjoys the challenge.

If you need help getting started or with a particular puzzle, you can check out our [hsv-dot-py channel](https://tech256.slack.com/archives/C495LAMS7) on tech256 ([sign up here](https://tech256.slack.com/)), add a message to our Meetup.com discussion, e-mail us at huntsville.py@gmail.com, or send a Meetup message and we'll help direct you! (Also, though not directly affiliated with our group, there are an active Reddit r/adventofcode and a general [Advent of Code Slack channel](https://tech256.slack.com/archives/CE8MV0GVC) on tech256.)

<h3>Hsv.py's 2020 Advent Challenges</h3>
This year we're doing prizes! Here are the rules to be eligible to win a prize:

1. Hsv.py's Advent 2020's timeline runs through January 10, 2021, for any submissions. Winners will be notified that week.
2. Players must be a member of the Hsv.py Meetup group and have a valid e-mail connected to their account for notification purposes. Unclaimed prizes will time-out after 30 days, so make sure we can contact you!
3. Players must join the Hsv.py leadership board on https://adventofcode.com/ (our leadership board code is: 135149-377bf0f5) and must be identifiable between Meetup and the leadership board and GitHub (so we can tell who is who).
4. Players must complete any 15 challenges from the 2020 year (any 15, does not have to be sequential) and at least 5 of these challenges must have both stars completed. The more challenges you complete, the better your placement within the group.
5. Players must publish their code in the Hsv.py repo for the challenges completed. Our repo is located [on GitHub](https://github.com/hsvpy/AdventOfCode2020).
6. Players must use Python for the challenges completed. (We're Hsv.py after all!)
7. The player with the most solved challenges by January 10th will receive the first place prize: the newly published Al Sweigart book, "Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python: Best Practices for Writing Clean Code". All other prizes will be great surprises! :)
8. If you have any questions about the rules, please send Ashley a Meetup.com message or send us an e-mail at Huntsville.py@gmail.com
9. Winners will be limited to the top 10. More challenges completed successfully and faster will factor into who wins in the case of close competition.

<h3>About Advent of Code</h3>
Advent of Code is a project created by Eric Wastl (@ericwastl); each year during the month of December, puzzles are listed on the [challenge website](https://adventofcode.com/). A new puzzle is listed each day of the month and requires code to solve (actually any language will work--but we especially love Python!). Puzzles are created for a variety of skill levels and are perfect for challenging yourself, others, or collaborating together to solve.
