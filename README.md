# AdventOfCode2020
Hsv.py Advent of Code 2020 Repository: Share code, tips, notes, and other useful info!

<h1>Hsv.py Advent of Code 2020!</h1>
This repository is meant for sharing code, tricks, tips, and anything that would be beneficial to others learning and improving their python skills.

<h3>How to contribute to this repo</h3>
If you'd like to share code, please add it in the appropriate day's folder with your name (or nickname--something that can be used to identify you through the meetup) and the challenge day #. If your code pertains to a specific part of the challenge (for example, the second star on day 3), please include the part in the filename. For example: <br>
guidoVanRossum_day3part2.py

If you want help getting started or with a particular Advent of Code challenge, feel free to start a discussion in our Slack channel, the advent of code slack channel, the Advent of Code subreddit, or start a discussion on our Meetup page.

<h3>About Advent of Code</h3>
Advent of Code is a project created by Eric Wastl; each year during the month of December, puzzles are listed on the challenge website https://adventofcode.com/ . A new puzzle is listed each day of the month and requires code to solve (actually any language will work--but we especially love Python!). Puzzles are created for a variety of skill levels and are perfect for challenging yourself, others, or collaborating together to solve.
